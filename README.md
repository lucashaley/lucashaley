I'm a Senior Lecturer in Game Development at Massey University in Wellington, New Zealand.

## I'm currently working on:

- Kyoto, a slow game about Japanese gardening.
- [We Agree That…](http://www.weagreethat.org), a website about axiomatic opinion in Rails. I'd love collaborators.
- How to best teach the techniques and ethics of game development.

## I'm currently learning:

- more and more about C#
- how to make bagels
